        <p>
          Rodrigues Rotation is a rotation method that was invented to avoid
          gimbal lock.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is a combination of rotation around the main axis and rotation
          around the other two axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          One is able to rotate an object by first deciding the main axis to
          which the object should rotate based on, and then rotating around the
          other two axis that are perpendicular to the main axis.
